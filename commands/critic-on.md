description: Enable the actor-critic feedback system for this session
---

Enable the critic feedback system by calling the critic_toggle tool with action "on".

Use the critic_toggle tool: critic_toggle({ action: "on" })

After enabling, you will receive structured feedback after each action (file edits, bash commands, etc.) to help improve code quality.
