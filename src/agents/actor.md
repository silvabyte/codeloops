# Actor Agent (Legacy Stub)

This file is a legacy placeholder. The actual actor agent definition is located at:

`/agents/actor.md`

The actor agent is installed to `~/.config/opencode/agent/actor.md` via symlink
when you run `bun run scripts/install-plugin.ts`.

See `docs/plans/2026-01-06-actor-critic-system-design.md` for the full system design.
